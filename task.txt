 Set up database connection and write functions to do the following:
connectToDatabase() – connect to your local MySQL or MongoDB
createMember(data) – add a new member to the database
getAllMembers() – get all members
getMemberById(id) – get a single member (used in edit)
updateMember(id, data) – update a member
deleteMember(id) – delete a member
:bulb: Use MySQL or MongoDB (whichever you know better). Share your functions with the team so they can call them.
